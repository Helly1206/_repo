hellyrepo.kodi:

This master branch only contains the repo zip file. Users can download and install from zip. The zip-file will be updated after a new repo version is released.

The repo folder (hellyrepo.kodi) is only used for users running Jarvis that are not updated to the new repo setup yet. They will be updated and the repo will point to the correct location. This repo folder will not be maintained anymore. You can find the correct repo and files on your version branch.
